#🌍 Air Quality Index Monitoring System
Welcome to my Air Quality Index (AQI) Monitoring System, a smart and insightful application designed to track, analyze, and visualize air quality levels in real time. This project focuses on transforming raw environmental data into meaningful insights, helping users understand pollution trends and make informed decisions for healthier living.

Built using modern web technologies and data-driven approaches, the application emphasizes performance, accuracy, and accessibility. It demonstrates my ability to work with environmental datasets, integrate APIs or sensor data, implement effective data visualization, and design user-friendly interfaces.

The system provides clear AQI indicators, pollutant breakdowns, and intuitive visual representations, making complex air quality metrics easy to interpret for both technical and non-technical users. This project reflects my interest in developing technology solutions that address real-world challenges while maintaining clean code, scalability, and best development practices.
